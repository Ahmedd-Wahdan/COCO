**make LAYERS like in pytorch linear(in_dim,out_dim) batchnorm1d(in_dim,out_dim)   to make it easy for the user to make the network**

**rewrite the backprobagation again**

**decouple the Layers classes from the Network class**

# Add conv2d(in_channels,out_channels,stride,padding) forward and backward pass

# make a central class Layer with functions forward and backward and make the others inherit from it
