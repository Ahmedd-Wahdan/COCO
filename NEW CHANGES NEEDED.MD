# Future Enhancements

In the upcoming versions, we aim to implement several key features and improvements to enhance the performance and usability of our model. Below is the list of proposed features:

## 1. GPU Support for COCO
- **Objective:** Add GPU support for COCO dataset processing to improve the speed and efficiency of training and evaluation.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Use CUDA-compatible libraries (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow) for data processing.
  - Implement data parallelism to utilize multiple GPUs effectively.
  - Optimize COCO-specific operations for GPU acceleration.

## 2. Backward Pass Handling of Residual Connections
- **Objective:** Ensure that the backward pass works seamlessly with residual connections in the network to maintain gradients properly during backpropagation.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Implement custom backpropagation logic for residual connections.
  - Ensure efficient gradient flow through the skip connections to avoid vanishing/exploding gradients.
  - Test with different architectures that use residuals (e.g., ResNet, ResNeXt).

## 3. Winograd Algorithm Implementation
- **Objective:** Implement the Winograd algorithm to speed up convolution operations, particularly for small kernels.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Research and integrate the Winograd minimal filtering algorithm.
  - Optimize convolution operations using this algorithm for faster processing.
  - Evaluate the speedup achieved compared to standard convolution methods.

## 4. FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for Convolutions
- **Objective:** Leverage FFT to accelerate convolution operations by transforming them into the frequency domain.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Implement FFT-based convolution to reduce the time complexity.
  - Test the trade-off between computational speed and memory usage.
  - Benchmark performance improvements on typical models.

## 5. Speed Optimization
- **Objective:** Enhance the overall speed of training and inference processes.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Profile the codebase to identify bottlenecks in performance.
  - Optimize code using techniques like mixed precision, quantization, and pruning.
  - Implement multi-threading and other parallelization techniques where possible.

## 6. Efficient Model Saving
- **Objective:** Save the trained model in a more efficient way to reduce storage space and improve load times.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Research lightweight serialization formats such as ONNX or TensorFlow Lite.
  - Implement model compression methods like quantization or pruning.
  - Allow for model checkpointing and resume functionality during training.

## 7. Function to Load Pretrained Model from Weights in H5 Format
- **Objective:** Provide an easy-to-use function to load pretrained models from `.h5` weights files.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Implement a function that reads `.h5` files and loads the weights into the model architecture.
  - Ensure compatibility with popular deep learning frameworks (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow).
  - Provide functionality to load both the model architecture and its weights.

## 8. Easy Integration of Pretrained Models with COCO
- **Objective:** Simplify the process of using pretrained models on the COCO dataset.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Create wrapper functions that seamlessly integrate pretrained models with COCO.
  - Provide pre-configured models trained on COCO, ready to use for inference or further training.
  - Implement an easy-to-use API for loading and using pretrained models on COCO.
